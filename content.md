**Update May 4, 2024**
Had a good semester of progress, just a quick update on the current status of the VTOL.
1) power systems and basic wiring have been completed
2) pixhawk remote telemetry is up and working at the moment.
3) We were able to get out to the Tucson Model Park and test our flight system

After a day of mixed successfulness at themodel park we now have a list of things to accomplish in the next coming year
*TBC*

**Update February 3, 2024**

This is the first update to the AZA website in 4 years! For awhile we had lost access to the old domain but we've updated the domain and we're back online. Currently we are working on our most recent project which is a VTOL (Vertical takeoff and landing). If you are interested in joining Arizona Autonomous Vehicles the make your way to the [Contact Us](./Contact/) page, and join our Discord. The majority of communication within the club happens there.
